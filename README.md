## Overview

I was accepted for the HNG internship on June 27th, 2024. This repository contains all the details of the tasks I completed on the front-end track.







## Stages Table

| STAGES | TASKS  | LINKS |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Stage 0   | **Write a technical article about frontend technologies:** On a blog platform of your choice, write a technical article comparing two different frontend technologies (anything is fine, the more niche, the better). Contrast the difference between each of them and what makes them better. In HNG, we use ReactJS, talk a little bit about what you expect to do in HNG and how you feel about React: |  [article-link](https://dev.to/miraclejustice/starting-your-front-end-journey-choosing-the-right-technologies-2jo7)  |        
| Stage 1   | **Build your personal website:** You will create and host a simple single-page website outlining your goals for the next 2 years in the tech field. The website should be visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and utilize HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. Each required element should have a specified data-testid attribute for easy identification and testing. | [page-link](https://mj-stageonetask.netlify.app/) |
